The temperature was above 30 degrees Celsius all the time. I drank 5 liters of water a day, and I was getting dehydrated anyway. Twice I had to take a two-hour break, I had to drink a few isotonic drinks, take magnesium, and wait for my body to regenerate, because the dizziness did not allow me to go any further.</p>

                                            <p>This is my absolute must-have food equipment. This is my protection in case there is no shop or bar anywhere on the way. During my trip to Podlasie, sometimes the distance between shops on the Green Velo trail is several dozen kilometers. And even when I found a store, I could only eat something on the spot. Then I try to eat mainly fruit to stay hydrated and provide the body with carbohydrates. Shops in Podlasie were often closed at 5 p.m., so I had to count only on my whey protein, nuts and dates. </p>
                                            <p><a name="_I"></a> I always start my day with a portion of whey protein, a handful of nuts and a few dates. And then, after leaving, I am looking for a bar or restaurant where I could eat a normal breakfast. </p>
                                            <p>Of course, I try to use the bars and restaurants whenever possible. There was no problem with that on the R10 trail. I was driving along the sea through tourist towns. Everywhere, all the bars and restaurants were open, even though it was June. Anyway, I always try to go on such trips in June. This is of great importance, because the day is then very long, and you can safely cycle until 21.30 before you find an overnight stay.</p>
                                            <p>In Podlasie, in June, bars and restaurants were open only in large cities. In smaller towns, everything was closed, and I only had to rely on shops and my packed lunch. And the shops were open for a very short time as I mentioned.</p>
                                            <p><a name="In"></a> In general, you rarely eat anything on campsites, but there are exceptions. At one of the campsites near Gołdap, I got the following breakfast:</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/K_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Not one hotel would be ashamed of such a breakfast. <br />Once, during my trip along the R10 route, in the campsite in Łazy, the owner brought me breakfast in a tent from a village a few kilometers away. His wife prepared breakfast for me. It was very nice to get breakfast in the tent at the campsite. <br /></p>
                                            <p>But it's not always so beautiful. Rather, you have to count on local shops and bars if these are open of course. If you already find a store, know that it will not be well supplied with food. </p>
                                            <p>Sometimes it is good to eat military pea soup. Sometimes you can find such pea soup tents. In this particular case, I paid once and it was very expensive, but I could eat up to ten plates. The host allowed me to take a photo exceptionally. Like a "military" object it is forbidden to photograph.</p>

But I had to eat my dinner on the steps of the store among the Belarusian drivers. It was fun too.</p>

The restaurant is run by very nice old people. They look after everything themselves. The food is delicious there. There you can eat the best dumplings and blood soup with pieces of liver. </p>

                                            <p>I am a big fan of black soup. It was always cooked in my home. I remember when I was a child. I know how good it should be and what not.</p>

                                            <p>Sometimes it is like that. Sausage with mustard in the woods. But how does it taste then!</p>

There is one in the village of Smołdziński Las. In this restaurant, the chef is Italian, and he cooks himself. And honestly, I ate some excellent pasta. And believe me, I've eaten a lot of pasta in my life. Even during my stay in Italy.</p>

The place is called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bar-Portowy-839949776189922/">Bar Portowy</a> and it is really nice there. All fish are fried and smoked on site. You can also buy other fish products at this bar.</p>

                                                <br />I really like seafood. During my stay in Italy, I ate tons of it. And I love the octopus the most. But calamari tripe is probably only possible in Poland.<br /></p>
                                            <p>Once, in a fishing port, I came across the best eel I've ever eaten in my life. And believe me, I live by the sea. I eat a lot of eel. This one was the best. I am writing about it here: <a href="Places.htm#The" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">The small fishing port of Unieście</a></p>
                                            <p>Of course, I have eaten hundreds of times in other places as well, but I would like to show you here the most interesting cases that I will remember for a long time.</p>
                                            <p>I wanted you in this chapter show that there is always not a colorful when it comes to food. Therefore, take care of a packed lunch. Besides, it is not difficult to go to the restaurant when it is open and eat something. Sometimes, all the bars and restaurants on the way are closed. Shops are also closed. And you have to handle it differently.</p>
                                            <p>The biggest curiosity, however, is that I never lose weight on my trips. I always weigh min. 3 kg more than before the trip. This is probably due to eating a lot of whey protein and fruit. My leg muscles get bigger and hence my weight gain. But I lose a few centimeters in my waist.</p>
