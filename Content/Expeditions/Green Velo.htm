                                            <h2>Day 1</h2>
                                            <p>Ełk - Szarejki, 50 km</p>
                                            <p>For my first long bike trip I chose the Green Velo trail. Maybe because it is very popular in Poland and highly publicized in the media. I did not consider anything else. The trail starts in Elbląg, but I decided to start it elsewhere. I wanted to get to Ełk by train, and from Ełk I wanted to ride by bike to enter the trail in the vicinity of Gołdap. Since it was my first time for such a long distance, I prepared myself very well physically for this trip. And I completed my equipment. I have already traveled with panniers before, but these were multi-day trips. I was planning to go away for three weeks for the first time. So I have completed everything that I thought was necessary. </p>
                                            <p>I also carried out a comprehensive bicycle service. I have planned my trip on June 7, 2020. So I had bought a train ticket to Ełk earlier and waited impatiently. When the day of departure came, I went to the railway station in Elbląg. I got to Ełk without any problems. There were many vacancies on the train. I even met a few cyclists who, like me, rode in Podlasie to start their first adventure with the Green Velo trail. In general, I was very excited all the time, but only when I got off in Ełk at the station, I really felt that I was starting my journey. As it was my first time in a long journey, I planned only 50 km to Szarejki for the first day. I even preliminarily made an appointment at the campsite. Later, I have not booked accommodation before. I arrived in Ełk at 3 p.m. and calmly headed north towards the village of Szarejki and the Green Velo trail. I did not visit Ełk. I have been to this city several times before. That's why I chose Ełk as my starting point because I know the mazuras from Elbląg to Ełk quite well. It was a pity for me to waste it for the first time in a region that I know well.</p>
                                            <p>I got to the campsite without any problems at 8 o'clock in the evening. Nothing happened on the route that would catch my attention. I was welcomed at the campsite by very nice young people and they showed me where I can pitch my tent. The place was cute. It was just me in the field. And also close to toilets and bathrooms, which even had a shower with a jacuzzi.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_1_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was excited. The first time I was to sleep in a tent on a bicycle trip. When I traveled before, I only slept in guest houses. I bought a tent especially for this trip. I pitched the tent without any problems, because earlier at home, as it was new, I made a dry test. As it was my first night, I had concerns, but as soon as I went to sleep in the tent, I fell asleep and forgot that I was in the tent. The night passed smoothly.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 2</h2>
                                            <p>Szarejki - Mauda, 62 km</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I had breakfast at the campsite at 8 o'clock. And at this campsite they served such breakfast that I have never eaten one again at the campsite. I wrote about this breakfast <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#In">here</a>. All this together with pitching a tent for PLN 45. Something amazing. </p>
                                            <p>After Breakfast, I put up my tent, packed my bags and hit the road towards Gołdap. Later, before Gołdapia, I turned right towards the village of Czarne by the Black Lake. There I was to enter the Green Velo trail. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the meantime, I was running out of water on the main road and it was getting hot. I thought to myself that I would definitely buy somewhere in these small towns. But none of this. There was no store anywhere. The first time I experienced a lack of water on my bike. The heat was incredible. I must have traveled twenty kilometers without water. There was only a shop in Zawiszyn. I have just experienced a shortage of shops in Podlasie on my own leather. I've read about it before in various forums. People said that the distance between shops is a big downside to Green Velo. I decided to keep one bottle in stock from now on. I have always bought more than I need so that the situation does not happen again. It's terrible to go so long without water in such heat. If my tire detector had broken, I would probably have died there. After this incident, I never ran out of water again.</p>
                                            <p>After replenishing the water in Zawiszyn and a fruit meal, I headed east all the time already following the trail. The road was nice and the surface was great. As it turned out later, only short sections are asphalt, and most of Green Velo are gravel roads.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was slowly approaching the first attraction on my route, the bridges in Stańczyki. I wrote about them <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#here">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>After visiting the bridges in Stańczyki, I headed towards the Border Tripoint in Wisztyniec. I also slowly started looking for some agritourism on my phone. I knew there was no tent field nearby. I called several places but nobody answered the phone. Well, I thought I would definitely find something along the way. In a small town whose name I do not remember, I went to a shop to buy water and fruit. By the way, I asked for accommodation. It turned out that the shop owner's cousin runs agritourism in Mauda. I even got a phone number. At least, that's something. I have a bearing, I thought to myself. </p>
                                            <p>I got to Wisztyniec in the afternoon. There was a statue of Green Velo at the entrance to the parking lot.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>BSA (MOR in Polish) was also there. BSA stands for Biker Service Areas. There are many such points on the Green Velo route every 8-10 kilometers from each other. All BSA are uniformly marked and equipped with shelters, benches, U-shaped bicycle stands, information boards and litter bins, and some also with portable toilets and water tanks.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the parking lot, officers of the Polish Border Guard warned me not to take any photos of the Russian side of the border. It is a big mandate. It is also not allowed to cross this border, even by extending an arm or a leg. There are cameras everywhere. Once, a tourist took a photo of herself in front of the border crossing point and posted it on Facebook. She was tracked down and had to pay a mandate. Such stories told me.</p>
                                            <p>Having been warned by them, I went to the place where the borders of three countries meet: Poland, Russia and Lithuania. I just took a picture of myself in front of the information board.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>It was getting late. I called agritourism. It turned out that it was not far from Wisztyniec. I set up the navigation and went to the place that was shown to me. I was slowly beginning to feel the hardships of the landscape. This land is Masuria Garbate. The terrain is very undulating. Some hills were so steep that I had to get off the bike and push it. </p>
                                            <p>I arrived at Mauda in the late afternoon. I remember that there were a lot of storks sitting on the folded straw.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There were very nice people in agritourism. They showed me my room and invited me to their house for dinner, which I had in the kitchen with them. This is what the people of Podlasie are like. They will take you home, feed you, and give you a place to stay. I am not saying that in other regions of Poland people are not like that, but in Podlasie and the entire eastern part of Poland, the kindness of people towards visitors is very much exposed. </p>
