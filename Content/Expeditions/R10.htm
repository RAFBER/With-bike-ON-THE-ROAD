                                            <p>I wanted to go to the mountains by bike this year. I wanted to see Bieszczady for the first time and visit places in the Beskidy that I know. I also wanted to cycle around the Tatra Mountains. However, the weather forecast for these regions was not very optimistic. At the last moment, I changed the direction of my trip. And I was not mistaken. There was heavy downpour, storms and floods in the south of the country, and beautiful weather in the north. Since I carry all my belongings with me, I had no problem doing it. I never book accommodation in advance. I always do it where I am. This is one of the many advantages of not planning such trips. No need to cancel reservations, apologize to people, waste money. </p>
                                            <h2>Day 1</h2>
                                            <p>Hel - Lubkowo on Lake Żarnowieckie, 85 km</p>
                                            <p>The first part of today's travel day I was going to drive by car. So I left Elbląg for Gdynia at 7 am. I was supposed to get to my friend's place in the Gdynia-Fikakowo estate, leave the car there in front of my friend's house, and together we were supposed to ride by bikes to Kościuszko Square. At 10 o'clock there was a ferry to the Hel Peninsula. <br />At 8 o'clock I was already in front of his house. On the spot, however, it turned out that I did not take a bicycle helmet! How could I forget him ?! This has never happened to me before. Luckily, Jacek, because that was his name, my friend had two helmets, so he lent me one. We arrived together at Kościuszko Square 45 minutes early. I like to be earlier if I have to be at a specific time. You never know what will happen along the way. Better to have some spare time. </p>
                                            <p>It was May 30, 2020, and I won't say, but it was cold in the morning. I had to wear all my clothes.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I like to ride alone. I don't like being dependent on someone, but in this case Jacek contacted me on Facebook if he could come with me for two days. Ok. I agreed. We haven't seen each other until secondary school, so it will be something to talk about. And I was right, we spent two nice days together.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I started to fear what the weather would be like on the Hel Peninsula. So I left the port in Gdynia with the two towers of the Sea Towers building, full of worries about the weather. The more that on the catamaran we sailed to the Hel Peninsula, you could feel a really strong wind.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p> It turned out, however, that the weather on Hel lightened up, and it got warm. At least, that's something. The weather was good for me. I started my trip in a place that is pompously called the <a href="http://www.gohel.pl/">Beginning of Poland</a>. Although some people, especially those coming from the south of the country, call this place the End of Poland.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <br />
                                                <img src="../Images/1_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The town itself is a very charming place, especially in the off-season. Its promenade and seal nursery, which unfortunately was closed that day, deserve attention. We didn't stay in Hel for too long. We only rode our bikes to the lighthouse, which was the first on my route, and continued our journey towards Władysławowo.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>On the way, we passed many fortifications, but we did not intend to visit them. Anyway, I have already been to the Hel Peninsula twice and visited a few of them. We stopped just for a moment at the pier in Jastarnia to observe how many people do kite surfing, and we cycled on. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There are many kite surfing schools on the Hel Peninsula. If you like this sport then this is the perfect place for you. Strong winds are blowing here, the Bay of Gdańsk is quite shallow here. The conditions for practicing this sport are perfect here.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_6_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>My mirror broke while cycling. Well, helmet first, then mirror. And all of this in one day. The mirror was probably damaged while transporting the bike on a catamaran. The expedition becomes interesting... The mirror is very helpful when riding a bicycle. Since I put them on for the first time, I can't imagine riding a bike without it. I'll have to buy something along the route in a bike shop.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The bicycle path itself on the Hel Peninsula is quite interesting, but in the season there is a lot of bicycle traffic on it, lots of children. It's easy to have an accident. That is why I do not recommend it in high season. On the way, we visited the <a href="https://wladyslawowo.pl/atrakcje/atrakcja/898/latarnia_morska_w_rozewiu">lighthouse in Rozewie</a> on the Rozewie Cape. I remember this lighthouse from the Mały Modelarz magazine. I glued one like this.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/1_8.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>We were slowly starting to think about accommodation. We agreed that we would stop half-wildly sleep on Lake Żarnowieckie. Half-wild because we were to pitch the tents on Jacek's friend's plot. We got to the town of Lubkowo, on Lake Żarnowiec, late in the evening. We pitched the tents in the dark.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>Lubkowo - Stilo, 51 km</p>
                                            <p>The morning at Lake Żarnowieckie welcomed us with beautiful weather. </p>

                                            <p>We decided to go around the lake and visit the ruins of an unfinished nuclear power plant. Unfortunately the area was fenced in and it was impossible to get too close to the ruins.</p>

                                            <p>We arrived at the campsite around 8 pm. We pitched the tents, lit a fire and had some time for memories from secondary school days.</p>

                                            <p>At night, it was 4.7 degrees C in the tent. Good thing I bought this new sleeping mat. Otherwise, he might not be able to stand the cold.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 3</h2>
                                            <p>Stilo - Łeba, 71 km</p>
                                            <p>Today it's time to say goodbye to Jacek because he had to go home. So I continued my journey alone. Unfortunately, Jacek was involved in making movies in Relive, because he was good at it. I have no patience with this application. I've already tried to tame her twice. I failed to. So the rest of the travel report will only be with photos. So from Stlio I headed towards the city of Łeba. There is a nice lighthouse in Stilo. However, the vision of pushing 700 meters uphill on the sand of my bike meant that I did not go to visit this lighthouse. I have been at this lighthouse before. Once is enough - I thought to myself. </p>
                                            <p>The road from Stilo to Łeba runs through the Mierzeja Sarbska nature reserve and is beautiful. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Partly between the Baltic dunes... </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>and Lake Sarbsko but also on the sand.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Just as she is beautiful, it is also difficult. Tree roots stick out everywhere along the path. However, it is a painful way. Additionally, there were fallen trees everywhere, through which I had to carry my bike.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>This route is only 13 km long and it took me 2.5 hours. Drama. On that day, I only visited the <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#Moving" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Moving dunes near Łeba</a>, which I wrote about in the <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Places</a> chapter. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Finally I fell over a lake somewhere halfway and lay there for half an hour. I did not want to ride further through these roots. I will never go again. Riding a bike must be fun, not a torture.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I only went towards the Great Swamp, but I had to turn back due to the late hour. The area around Lake Łebsko, known as the Great Swamp , is also a very difficult area. I found out about it the next day. Luckily I turned back. You have to go there early to go there in one day.</p>
                                            <p>I stayed at the Marco Polo campsite for the night. A very civilized place. </p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Oh, I also glanced at the beach in Łeba. No people. I like such holidays. When I was in Łeba in July, it was impossible to put your feet on the beach. Towel by the towel. Not for me.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/3_7.jpg" />

                                            <h2>Day 4</h2>
                                            <p>Łeba - Smołdziński Las, 73,5</p>
                                            <p>In the morning I was in no hurry with my departure time. I left the campsite at 1:30 pm and it was not a good time. But I slept for 8 hours that day. For the first time. I was tired because the previous nights I had slept for about 4 hours. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/4_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Either way, it was a little too late. After all, today I had to cover a very difficult terrain. Great Swamp.<br />What is the Great Swamp? It is simply a large swamp area between the mouth of the Łeba River and the southern shore of Lake Łebsko. South of the Żarnowska - Gać bicycle route. The road runs through the forest and is passable in this section. There are viewing footbridges here. It is a really charming place.</p>
                                            <p>.<img src="../Images/4_1_1.jpg" /></p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/4_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>But further from Izbica to Kluki it is not easy. This area is the Bagna Izbickie nature reserve, a place about which legends circulate among cyclists. And above all, the bicycle path from Izbica to Kluki through Lisia Góra. It is a very difficult terrain to travel by bike. A lot depends on the water level in this area. Sometimes the trail is so hard that you have to push the bike in the mud. The mud may be halfway up the bicycle wheels. </p>
                                            <p>I avoided Lisia Góra, because I met cyclists who were returning from there and told me to turn back. Their bikes were covered with mud and their feet were covered with mud up to their knees. They raided 2.5 km in three hours. I turned back and rided through Głowczyce. But before Kluki I didn't miss the swamps. Fortunately for me, the water level was low and the wooden footbridges worked.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/4_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>It is impossible to ride on these footbridges all the time, because they are only in some places. I often had to go on foot, pushing the bike.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/4_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I got to Kluk around 8 p.m. It took me 5 hours to drive 33 km. This is not a very good result. But the terrain was difficult. In Kluki, on the Łebsko Lake, which is really big. I took a picture of myself. In the background you can see the <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#Moving" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Moving dunes near Łeba</a> in the distance.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/4_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the village of Kluki there is also the Museum of the Słowińska Village, which, however, was already closed. Anyway, I had to look for a camping site because it was really late.</p>

                                            <p>Fortunately for me, there was a campsite in Smołdziński Las. Also, I had only 6 km to ride, but I was pitched my tent in the dark.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 5</h2>
                                            <p>Smołdziński Las - Ustka, 50 km</p>
                                            <p>Smołdziński Las is a small, quiet town. If I were to choose a place to relax by the sea, it is possible that I would choose this village. There were really few people there and  important, there was a good Italian restaurant, which I wrote about <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#Some">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>There is the Czołpino lighthouse near the Smołdziński Las. This is probably the most beautifully situated lighthouse, of the ones I passed along the entire route.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/5_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The lighthouse building itself is also very nice. It is shame that I couldn't get inside the lighthouse. There would be a beautiful view from above for sure. In general, all lighthouses were closed to visitors due to the pandemic. Too bad.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/5_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was sad to leave this place because it was really nice. I even took a picture of the camping to bring back memories from time to time.</p>
                                            <p>The next place on my route was Smołdzino. And I found such a curiosity there. Monument with a red star. It is a monument to the fallen Soviet soldiers. It's strange that they didn't remove it.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>In Smołdzino I cycled to the village of Rowy. The R10 route ran between Lake Gardno and the Baltic Sea. There are also observation towers from which you can admire the landscape of Lake Gardno.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>I got to Rowy quite early by bike. There was time to go to the beach...</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/5_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>... and take a walk along the seaside promenade.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/5_6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I also ate in Rowy the best toast I have ever eaten. The owners themselves bake bread for these toasts. Really, it is a must see in Rowy. On tripadvisor.com, Tościarnia Pub, because that's what the place is called, has a rating of 5. I'm not posting a photo because I've already gnawed it, but you have to take my word for it. Really good. The bar owners traveled the entire coast first to see if anyone was making such toasts. These are the best toasts on the Polish coast.</p>

                                            <p>After eating a delicious toast, I cycled along the Trail of the Rolled Tracks to Ustka. </p>

                                            <p>In Ustka pitched a tent in the camping Borowinka. There was a very nice service and it was just me in the whole campsite.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 6</h2>
                                            <p> Ustka - Darłówko, 61 km</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Ustka is probably the most beautiful city I have passed on the route. It has beautiful architecture of buildings and very nice beaches. I will not write too much. See for yourself, there is a lot to see. I spent 3 hours in the city walking around the small streets and admiring the buildings of Ustka.</p>
                                            <p>At the beginning I sat on a bench with Irena Kwiatkowska. I was dressed a bit inappropriately, but I don't think she took offense at me. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_02.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>And then, after lunch at a bar, I went out to explore the city...</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_03.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There was also a pretty lighthouse in Ustka.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_05.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I saw such a construction for the first time. Swivel bridge in Ustka over the Słupia River and the port entrance.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_06.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The views from the breakwater are also interesting. Ustka has very nice wide beaches.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_07.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_09.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_10.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_08.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>And this is the building of the Ustka Harbor Master's Office. The lighthouse in the background.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_11.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was delighted with the development of the boulevard on the Słupia River.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_12.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>But the old buildings in Ustka are the most beautiful. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_13.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Tourist information building. I like this old, low-rise building.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_14.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_16.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_17.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Ustka even has a cinema. I like going to such cinemas a lot. They have their own atmosphere. This is the Delfin cinema.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_18.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Finally, I ate a delicious pork chop in Bar Klusek. Really good home made dinners.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/6_19.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>When I choose places where to eat, I rather avoid the main promenades. There is food typical of tourists. Places such as the one located in the interior of the city must attract customers with tasty food. I was not wrong. The food was really good. When I am in Ustka again and I want to eat something, I will direct my first steps there.</p>

                                            <p>It was with great regret that I left this city, but I promised myself that I would return there one day. I wanted to get to Darłówko today...</p>
                                            <p>I left Ustka on road no. 203 to Jarosławiec, and then in Zaleskie I turned towards Jarosławiec. In Jorosławiec, I only glanced at the lighthouse. I ate a waffle with strawberry jam and whipped cream and I left Jarosławiec towards Darłówek along the seaside trail.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>One of the prettiest routes I have ever ridden. Mostly asphalt and some slabs, but very smooth. And above all, by the sea, and for a while between the sea and Lake Kopań.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>The beaches in this place were really pristine.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p> And the road ... I couldn't get over my delight. It was quite late in the day. The sun was heading west. The atmosphere became amazing. In the distance I could already see Darłówko...</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>...which greeted me with its lighthouse. Another one on my route.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>The city was so calm that I will not forget this atmosphere until the end of my life. </p>

                                            <p>I stayed for the night at the cozy Róża Wiatrów camping.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 7</h2>
                                            <p>Darłówko - Łazy, 51.5km</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the morning I was awakened by a rain in the tent. It rained heavily. Rain is not an obstacle to cycling. You just need to dress well. But today it was raining too hard. Another problem is packing a wet tent. You have to wait for it to dry a little. So I had to wait until it stopped raining a bit and my tent dried up a bit. So I sat down in the tent and listened to the radio. I used this time to rest. I also ate my first breakfast.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Finally, at 11 o'clock it stopped raining. So I packed quickly, packed my tent and left. The tent was a bit wet when I packed it. I knew that I had to find a campsite that day. The tent had to be pitched today. Couldn't stay wet in the pannier.</p>
                                            <p>I left Darłówek without looking back too much. On the way, I just passed the very funny building of the water tram harbor.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>The first city on my route was Darłowo. A very nice town with a nice main square in the city center. I really like this layout of the cities. I always like to sit in this place for a while.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the center of the square there is a monument to the Fisherman. In the background the building of the Municipal Office in Darłowo.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I also took a photo of the monument to Stanisław Dulewicz, the first mayor of Darłowo after the Second World War. It contributed significantly to the development of the city.</p>

                                            <p>There is, among others, the Pomeranian Dukes' Castle, which I wanted to visit, but was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anyway, almost all museums on my route were closed for this reason. The castle is located on the Wieprza river in Darłowo.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>I left Darłowo and headed for the village of Dąbki. I wanted to get to Łazy along the sea road. As it turned out later, the road was closed. I would have to push my bike a few kilometers on the beach. So I had to turn back and ride around Bukowo Lake.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>On the way, I passed the Szczuczy Canal, which connects Lake Bukowo with the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is visible in the background.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_8.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>That day, the rain accompanied me almost until the evening. Bicycle routes in the West-Pom. just a fairy tale. Ever since I crossed the borders of the province, I have been following great paths all the time. I hope that it will be like that until Świnoujście.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_9.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Fortunately, the rain had stopped, the sun came out and I was able to dry a bit. There was also a chance that he would pitch the tent and it would also be able to dry. I went further to the village of Łazy. On the way, I took a picture of myself at Lake Jamno. As it turned out later, on the other side I found a great campsite where I was met with the incredible kindness of the campsite owner.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_10.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I passed a nice hotel on the way that had a "Cyclist friendly" sign but they didn't have a washing machine. And I wanted to wash everything after today. I cycled on. I arrived at the Osada nad Wodą campnig around 8 p.m. The owner, a very young nice man, had a washing machine at the campsite, but not connected. However, he promised me that when I stayed, he would connect it especially for me. Plus, in the morning, he'll bring me breakfast to my tent. I was on cloud nine. </p>
                                            <p>I have washed almost all of my clothes. I also pitched my tent. The weather forecast for tomorrow was promising. So there was a chance that my tent would dry up. <br />I found also a moment to sit in the evening and look at the full moon shining beautifully over Lake Jamno.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/7_11.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>People in Pomerania are really polite, but during this camp I met with exceptional kindness. I promised the owner that I would always recommend his campsite.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 8</h2>
                                            <p>Łazy - Unieście, Day of rest.</p>
                                            <p>Not only did the owner of the campsite connect a washing machine for me in the evening, he also promised me that he would bring me breakfast in the morning from his wife. After a week of eating dried dates, nuts, and whey protein for my breakfast, such SOMETHING! The owner fried scrambled eggs and bacon for me at the campsite so the scrambled eggs were warm.<br />In the background a view of the Jamno lake. Added value to the contract.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_02.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I thought that if these people are so nice I will stay with them longer to rest. They had a guesthouse in the town of Unieście, to which I was only a few kilometers away. </p>
                                            <p>It also turned out that the owner's wife owned a guest house in Unieście near Mielno. <br />The tent was dry in the sun so I could pack my stuff and ride on. My clothes were already dry too.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>On the way, I only got to the beach to see the mouth of the Jamneński Channel into the Baltic Sea. A very beautiful place.</p>

                                            <p>I found their guesthouse without any problems. It was the Villa Arkadia guesthouse. Very nicely arranged with all the comforts. Very nice service. I highly recommend this place. It is away from the center of Mielno, but very close to the Mielno district, to the fishing port of Unieście.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>And that was the breakfast at my guesthouse. They really care about people here.</p>

                                            <p>I checked into the guesthouse, took a bath and went to visit Unieście and Mielno. Besides, I wanted to regenerate properly so bars and restaurants became my goal. I had to eat well after seven days of riding. The first bar was the Sum Bar. I highly recommend this place. Home kitchen, run by an old lady. For starters, I ate delicious dumplings with meat. The dumplings were homemade.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_19.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Later I went to the port of Unieście. And there I have already found a paradise for the palate. Fish everywhere. Smoked and fried straight from the sea. And the smell of smoked fish everywhere. I ordered an eel, for which I had to wait 30 minutes. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_27.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>So I went to visit the beach which was very beautiful.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_25.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_23.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I finally got my eel. It was pulled straight off the hook and warm. Only such eel tastes best. And fresh bread. There's nothing better. And a lake view of the Baltic Sea. What would I want more...</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_44.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>This bar is called UNI-RYBY Bosman. Only they had eels and sold fresh fish. I read various reviews about this bar. Some customers praise this bar and others don't.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_79.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I had a delicious eel and I recommend this bar. Remember, however, that I was there outside the strict season. Then the fish are definitely worse. Only the quantity sold counts. This is one of the many reasons why I never go on vacation in July and August. Besides, I am very picky about food. I choose places where I eat very meticulously. I hardly ever eat anything bad. The more that I cook a lot at home, so I know food.</p>

                                            <p>After eating eel, I went to see Mielno. A very nice holiday town. And since it was June, there weren't many tourists. So it was very quiet.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>The walrus monument is a symbol of the International Walrus Rally organized in Mielno since 2004, attended by thousands of winter bathing enthusiasts.</p>

                                            <p>Mielno has a very nice main entrance to the beach.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_52.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I sat for a while on the restaurant terrace and admired the beach in Mielno.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_56.jpg" />

                                            <p>Finally, I went to my guesthouse along the seaside promenade.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/8_62.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Such a recovery day came in handy. I felt that I was gaining strength. Always on such trips, the first week is the worst before the body gets used to the daily effort. I felt that I was resting.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 9</h2>
                                            <p>Unieście and Mielno, another day of rest.</p>
                                            <p>I really didn't do anything that day. I was lying on the beach all day and relaxing. On the beach I met a friend from my neighborhood where I grew up in Elbląg. We haven't seen each other for many years. There was something to talk about.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>For dinner, I only went to the Sum bar for a while, because it is close to the beach. </p>

                                            <p> I felt refreshed. I already knew that I would go on my way the next day.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <h2>Day 10</h2>
                                            <p>Mielno - Niechorze, 100 km</p>
                                            <p>Two days of regeneration and I was able to cycle 100 km straight away. I also visited several beautiful places.</p>
                                            <p>First there was the village of Chłopy. It is a small and cozy resort town with a fishing port. It was so nice there that I stood on the pier for a while and looked at the beach.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Later, I visited the charming lighthouse in Gąski and ate a delicious waffle with a strawberry jam and whipped cream there. Usually, when I see a waffle stand, I usually stop to refill the carbohydrates. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Ustronie Morskie was also quite a nice place. There's an old, long pier there. I was able to take a picture of the beach panorama from the sea.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Would like to go further ... End of the road.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The journey from Ustronie Morskie to Kołobrzeg is already nice. You ride the bike path by the beach all the time. However, in high season there may be a lot of cyclists there. I always go on trips in June. Thanks to this, I can enjoy the relative tranquility on the bicycle paths and campsites.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_9.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The largest of the places visited today - Kołobrzeg surprised me with its architecture of the center and this building of the City Hall. I liked Kołobrzeg very much. One of the most beautiful cities I have passed on the road.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_8.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Kołobrzeg has probably the most beautiful lighthouse on the entire route. Well, maybe in Czołpino it is even prettier and very nicely situated on a hill in the forest. But when it comes to the city's lighthouses, the one in Kołobrzeg is probably the prettiest.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There could also miss the pictures of the monument Polish Marriage to the Sea in my guide.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>The breakwaters in Kołobrzeg cut deep into the sea.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_11.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>You can make very nice photos of the beach in Kołobrzeg from them.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/10_12.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p> In general, I associate Kołobrzeg with the Soldier Song Festival... </p>
                                            <p>I got to Niechorze quite late in the evening and stayed at the campsite. Earlier, in the town of Mrzeżyno, I ate calamari tripe, which I wrote about <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#One">here.</a> It was a very interesting experience.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 11</h2>
                                            <p>Niechorze - Świnoujście, 100 km.</p>

                                            <p>In Niechorze I slept at a very nice campsite. I even managed to hang up the string and wash my clothes.</p>

                                            <p>Before leaving Niechorze, I had a delicious breakfast at Cafe Porto. It turned out that the owner is also a pannier cyclist. So we had many topics in common, we exchanged experiences that he had much greater than mine. So I was able to learn a lot of interesting things.</p>

                                            <p>I asked only one other gentleman to take a photo of me with the lighthouse in the background and I left this beautiful town. I don't have too many photos like this. I usually take pictures myself. I am also very pleased with this photo. In the background the lighthouse in Niechorze.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>I only had 100 km to Świnoujście, so I decided to cycle this distance in one day. On the way, I passed several smaller resorts such as Rewal, Pobierowo, Dziwnów,  and Międzyzdroje, hich is famous in Poland for its Star Promenade. But to be honest, I was so disappointed with Międzyzdroje that I didn't even take any pictures there. I believe that this is an artificially blown point on the map.</p>
                                            <p>They were all very nice, in Rewal I even stopped to eat something longer, because there were very nice beaches.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>From the places worth seeing during this episode, it was the highest cliff in Poland. Gosań. I described it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#Gosań">here</a>. At about the 7 pm I reached Swinoujście. I already had 600 km on my odometer.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>I went to see the last lighthouse on my route. It was one of the ugliest I have seen on my coastal route. </p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>There are two ferry crossings in Świnoujście from Wolin Island to Uznam Island. One is only for Świnoujście residents, as well as pedestrians and cyclists who do not live in Świnoujście. It's called Świnoujście - Warszów and it is much closer when you ride by bike. The second one is called Karsibór - Świnoujście and is much further from Świnoujście. This ferry crossing is for all other citizens wishing to cross to the island of Usedom. </p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Of course, as a non-resident cyclist I chose the closer one, but before that I went to the beach in Warszów, where is an gas terminal that allows to receive liquefied gas (LNG) from anywhere in the world.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Contrary to Miedzyzdroje, I liked the promenade in Świnoujście very much. There were a lot of modern buildings, </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/11_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>and also those that refer to the older period with their architecture.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/11_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There are very wide beaches in Świnoujście. I have not seen such wide beaches on the Polish coast before.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>Finally, after reaching my milestone, I gave myself a reward. I ate a very good pizza in an Italian restaurant on the promenade in Świnoujście.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>This pizza made me pitch my tent on the campsite in the dark, but it was worth the wait as it was really good. </p>

And I had to go back for it doing 34 km more that day. I had to go back for him. I felt like I had lost my travel companion...</p>

                                            <p>My first breakfast is always whey protein, nuts, dates, isotonic drink, magnesium. I eat them in a tent. I wrote about it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#_I">here</a>. But when I have the opportunity to eat a second breakfast before leaving the city where I am, it looks like this. It's just duże. I eat pasta whenever I have the opportunity, because pasta provides energy for hours. Before leaving Świnoujście, I had a second breakfast at a good Italian restaurant, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Restauracja-Trattoria-Familia-409122179866756/">Tratoria Familia.</a> </p>
                                            <p>For the first course, I usually order a salad or a soup.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/12_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The main course must be pasta. No matter what pasta and with what. That there was only pasta. Pasta provides the body with complex carbohydrates.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>And finally, dessert and coffee with a lot of sugar that will provide the body with simple carbohydrates and caffeine. So "refueled" you can go a long way by bike and not feel physically fatigued for hours.</p>

                                            <p>After leaving Świnoujście and the ferry crossing, I decided to visit the Underground City. It is a secret command post during the "Cold War", one of the most closely guarded military secrets, which was visited by Wojciech Jaruzelski. </p>

                                            <p>The museum complex is situated in the forest between the railway station "Świnoujście - Przytór" and the beach.</p>

                                            <p>I got very cold during this museum tour, because it was only 9 degrees C inside, and I was wearing shorts. Besides, I was warm after cycling. The museum is located underground and hence the low temperature inside. I feel a little cold after today. Fortunately, I did not have to sleep in the tent today, but found a good guesthouse at the gas station in Wolin.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 13</h2>
                                            <p>Wolin - Szczecin, 100 km, 81 km of which by train. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the morning before leaving Wolin, I decided to visit the Center of Slavs and Vikings. A very interesting place. It was established on the initiative of several enthusiasts of the culture of the Slavs and Vikings in these areas. The goal is to recreate the history of Wolin from 1000 years ago. The settlement is located on the Dziwna River.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The settlement has 27 huts, 2 gates with ramparts and defensive fortifications, and a harbor quay. These are replicas from early medieval Wolin.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I ate a herring hamburger there. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The roll was baked on site in a wood-fired oven. I even liked it.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>And when I was eating a grilled sausage in a local "restaurant" the horse came to the table. The first time I saw a horse in a restaurant. I thought for a moment that I hadn't woken up yet, or that my cold was more serious than I thought.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>I even managed to make a random acquaintance and talk a moment about the settlement. </p>

                                            <p>In the afternoon, the rain found me in Szczecin. So I had to visit this city all wet. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>On the spot in Szczecin, I visited Wały Chrobrego. A must-see when you come to Szczecin. For my cold yesterday, this rain did not help me at all. I even considered going home. But there was no good rail connection. Maybe that's a good thing, because in the morning it turned out that I had passed my cold and the weather turned to summer. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_8.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>And Szczecin .... Well, I have never been to Szczecin in my life and I wanted to see this city. After such attractions as I have seen on the Polish coast, seeing the monuments is not very exciting. But I was, I saw - passed. I only took a look at the building of the Mieczysław Karłowicz Philharmonic. I read later that this building of the philharmonic hall became the most beautiful building in Europe in 2015 ... I didn't like this building at all.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/13_9.jpg" />

                                            <p> I didn't feel very well after yesterday's cold. I decided to travel from Wolin to Szczecin by train. I stayed overnight in a warm and cozy hotel. I took paracetamol and went to bed early. If I feel so bad tomorrow, I'm going home.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 14</h2>
                                            <p>Szczecin - Osetna, 92 km. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/14.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Fortunately, the cold has passed. So I could then continue cycling. Before leaving, a photo of the Odra River in Szczecin.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/14_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p> The sights look much better when lit by the sun and it's quite nice to hang your eye on them. On the way, I decided to visit the Szmaragdowe Lake. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/14_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The artificial lake was created in the excavation of the former chalk mine. On the way I also visited the Krzywy Las. Apparently it was created as a result of deliberate human activity. I wrote about the Crooked Forest  <a href="../D_More Information/Curiosities.htm#Crooked">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>Today, my first day on the bike was warm and I didn't have to wear all my clothes and a balaclava. The seaside section, although I was cycling it in fine weather (with some exceptions), it is always a seaside route. The sun is warm, but the sea wind made the air cool and the nights cold. 5-6 degrees C in a tent at night is a standard. Only today, when I cycled inland, I felt the summer. I hope it will stay that way until the end.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, I ended up in a very nice guesthouse and I think I'll stay here longer... There are still 240 km to Mogilno, because that was where I was going to ride.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 15</h2>
                                            <p>The 15th day of my trip was spent entirely on rest. I stayed for two nights in a beautiful guesthouse Zielone Wzgórze on Lake Będzin. There was very good food there. A woman from Ukraine was cooking in the kitchen. She made me pancakes for breakfast. I have not eaten tastier pancakes in the past. Apparently, these Ukrainian pancakes are very famous among many customers who, due to the good food, often stay in this guesthouse.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/15_1.jpg" />

                                            <p>During the day I also visited the nearby village of Lipiany. </p>

                                            <p>A very small and charming town.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <h2>Day 16</h2>
                                            <p>Lipiany - Czarnków, 127 km of which 26 by train.</p>
                                            <p>After day 15, when I was doing NOTHING all day in a guesthouse by the lake, I had to get back together and pedal a little. The road was boring. Maybe that's a good thing, because I already have a lot of attractions and I want to get to Mogilno as quickly as possible, so I don't waste time to stop constantly and take photos. Along the way, there are several churches that are abundant in Poland, as well as a nice-looking abandoned mausoleum at Wieleń. If someone likes such dark, abandoned places, it is worth keeping them in mind.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/16_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Probably the most interesting thing about today's road is the train journey from Stare Kurowo to Krzyż. Only 112 km left to Mogilno. Maybe thanks to today's PKP train I will get there tomorrow evening .... The route was not only boring, but also against the wind all the time. I have never ridden 100 km against the wind all the time. My knees were slowly starting to fail in the evening. Even the coastal sections did not give me a hard time like the one today. And also the morning rescue of a deer that got stuck in the fence. I don't know how it ended, because I had to leave, but there were so many people there that they definitely freed him.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 17</h2>
                                            <p>Czarnków - Mogilno, 119 km.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/17.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The route is more interesting than the previous day, but also without fireworks. In addition, the vision of the distance that I had to ride today meant that I limited the stops for rest and taking photos to a minimum. I tensed also with the time of departure. 9:45 is an absolute record on this expedition and it probably won't be broken for a long time. On the way, I passed many places as usual and I wish I could have stayed there longer. Czarnków and Wągrowiec have a very nice main square in the center, but unfortunately I decided to go head-to-head that day so as not to arrive at the monastery too late. In Wągrowiec, I ate only a delicious onion steak in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bar-Kawiarnia-Justynka-258992114236963/">Justynka Bar</a> and immediately left the city. So I didn't sit for a while as I usually do. </p>

                                            <p>However, I promised myself that when I was nearby, I would have to visit these two towns. Unfortunately, during such trips I constantly have a dilemma whether to "make kilometers" or visit and take photos. Everything was clear at the seaside. I was in no hurry so I focused on sightseeing. It had to be different here - the priority was to move to Mogilno as quickly as possible. The distance of 119 km at a fairly fast pace after yesterday's hundred against the wind was not an easy one, especially the last 10 km is a "torment road". But thanks to this, I managed to reach the monastery at 6:30 pm, check in and go out for a pizza. I stayed for the night in the monastery I wrote about <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#Benedict">here</a> in <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm">Places</a> chapter.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 18</h2>
                                            <p>Day 18 was devoted entirely to rest. I visited several places in Mogilno that I knew, which I got to know when I lived in this city. Mogilno is a very small town in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. The population is 12,000. It is very picturesquely situated on Lake Mogilno. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/18_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>But for such a small house it is very well developed industrially. There are a lot of companies, a cinema, a swimming pool and everything you need to live. I used to live in this city for almost a year and I have very fond memories of this stay.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <h2>Day 19</h2>
                                            <p>Mogilno - Przyjezierze, 56 km.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/19.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>After the 18th day, which I devoted to visiting old, familiar "corners" in Mogilno, I went on a small tour around the area to places that I liked to visit while living in Mogilno. When I was here for the first time, the number of lakes surprised me. In the town of Ostrowo on Lake Powidzkie, I visited several charming beaches in the forest that I had known before. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/19_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I did not think that apart from Warmia and Masuria and the Kashubian Lake District, there are still places in Poland where there are so many of them. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/19_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I also visited a windmill from 1803, converted into a residential building, and ... well, the bar next to the windmill in the forest no longer exists.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/19_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Along the way, as usual, a few churches and those purple fields that have accompanied me since I started to head towards Mogilno from Gryfino. I think I have only passed a rapeseed field once, and so it is only violet fields and full of red poppies. I checked that this violet was blue phacelia. A multi-purpose plant that was brought to us from North America. The photos do not fully reflect this, but the live fields look very effective.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/19_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I finished the my trip in Przyjezierze, a holiday resort on Lake Ostrowskie, where I was for the first time 29 years ago and whenever I have the opportunity, I come back here with great sentiment.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/19_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I have already cycled 1062 km on the odometer and 107 km more by train, the holiday is slowly coming to an end. I still have about 40 km to Inowrocław, where I will visit a friend, an avid pannier cyclist, we will sit, talk, look at photos from the expeditions, and the next day I get on the train and go home.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 20</h2>
                                            <p>Przyjezierze - Inowrocław, 53 km, of which 20 "on the back" of the car. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images/20.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I left Przyjezierze at 12 o'clock, because I didn't have to hurry. I had to ride only 53 km. On the way, a delicious dinner in Kwieciszewo. I described it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#Som">here</a>, and a meeting with a friend in Strzelno. As it always happens, the meeting dragged on and a storm broke out over Strzelno, which made it impossible to continue cycling. So we loaded the bike onto the car and drove to Inowrocław. So I cycled 1095 kilometers and the last 20 km due to the storm was impossible. And in the evening, at the end of the trip, a well-deserved beer in the Old Town in Inowrocław ... </p>
                                            <h2>Day 21</h2>
                                            <p>It's time to ride home. <br />I stayed at my friend's in Inowrocław. Marcin is also an avid cyclist. And he also rides a bike with panniers like me. I left Marcin's at 6 am. On the way to the train station, I visited the spa part of Inowrocław with saline graduation towers, which were still in the fog at that time of the day.<br /></p>

                                            <p>Before leaving Inowrocław I have breakfast at the Dworcowy bar. Very good scrambled eggs and goulash soup.</p>

                                            <p>Thank you to everyone who wanted to read my scribbles and see photos of dubious quality. </p>

                                            <p>The expedition is over. I endured 3 weeks this year. I am not tired physically, but remember that such a trip is also a mental effort. Last year in Podlasie I was able to ride a bike only 14 days. Each next trip will be easier to survive. This is how you get experience. This report is only a small excerpt from what I experienced during my trip, but it is impossible to describe everything. I hope that at least I have brought you closer to the atmosphere that accompanied me.</p>
                                            <p>The first time I saw the whole Polish coast. And I can only say one thing. It is beautiful. I have seen lots of beautiful places, eaten lots of great food. I met a lot of interesting and polite people.</p>
                                            <p>But traveling without a plan also has its disadvantages. Certainly, I missed many interesting places, although it is known that it is impossible to see everything. However, I wish I had seen two places. I would like to mention these places so that you do not make my mistake and by being so close you will not miss them.<br />The first one is the ruins of the church in Trzęsacz, which you can read about <a href="http://www.wkz.szczecin.pl/mainjoo/index.php?option=com_phocagallery&amp;view=category&amp;id=6:trzesacz&amp;Itemid=77">here</a>. They are beautifully situated on a dune, right by the sea. The other one is the <a href="https://www.miedzyzdroje.net.pl/atrakcje/9/jezioro_turkusowe">Turkusowe Lake</a> on the Wolin Island, in the town of Wapnica. I have passed this lake four times. And I didn't get there. You definitely have to visit the lake when the weather is nice. Then the lake surface will have the right color. When it comes to the ruins of the church in Trzęsacz, I would not put it off until retirement. This church stands too close to the cliff ...</p>

                                            <p>Coordinates (Turkusowe Lake): <a href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?language=pl&amp;pagename=Jezioro_Turkusowe&amp;params=53.876944444444_N_14.438888888889_E_type:waterbody">53°52′37″N 14°26′20″E</a></p>
                                            <p>The Turkusowe Lake was the only one place I thought about before starting my expedition that I would like to see. And while I was there, I forgot about him. Well, it happens. This is how planning ends. That is why I try not to plan anything on such a trip, because at home at the desk everything looks different than with a bike on the road. There will be an opportunity to cycle along the Polish coast once again.<br /></p>
                                            <p>I will have to wait a year for the next trip again. Hope only a year...</p>
