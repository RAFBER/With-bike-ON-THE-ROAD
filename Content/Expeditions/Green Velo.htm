                                            <p>The Green Velo Eastern Bicycle Trail - a bicycle route leading through five voivodeships in eastern Poland, i.e. the Lubelskie, Podlaskie, Podkarpackie, Świętokrzyskie and Warmińsko-Mazurskie voivodships. I have decided that this year I will ride to the Podlasie section of this trail.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 1</h2>
                                            <p>Ełk - Szarejki, 50 km</p>
                                            <p>For my first long bike trip I chose the Green Velo trail. Maybe because it is very popular in Poland and highly publicized in the media. I did not consider anything else. The trail starts in Elbląg, but I decided to start it elsewhere. I wanted to get to Ełk by train, and from Ełk I wanted to ride by bike to enter the trail in the vicinity of Gołdap. Since it was my first time for such a long distance, I prepared myself very well physically for this trip. And I completed my equipment. I have already traveled with panniers before, but these were multi-day trips. I was planning to go away for three weeks for the first time. So I have completed everything that I thought was necessary. </p>
                                            <p>I also carried out a comprehensive bicycle service. I have planned my trip on June 7, 2020. So I had bought a train ticket to Ełk earlier and waited impatiently. When the day of departure came, I went to the railway station in Elbląg. I got to Ełk without any problems. There were many vacancies on the train. I even met a few cyclists who, like me, rode in Podlasie to start their first adventure with the Green Velo trail. In general, I was very excited all the time, but only when I got off in Ełk at the station, I really felt that I was starting my journey. As it was my first time in a long journey, I planned only 50 km to Szarejki for the first day. I even preliminarily made an appointment at the campsite. Later, I have not booked accommodation before. I arrived in Ełk at 3 p.m. and calmly headed north towards the village of Szarejki and the Green Velo trail. I did not visit Ełk. I have been to this city several times before. That's why I chose Ełk as my starting point because I know the mazuras from Elbląg to Ełk quite well. It was a pity for me to waste it for the first time in a region that I know well.</p>
                                            <p>I got to the campsite without any problems at 8 o'clock in the evening. Nothing happened on the route that would catch my attention. I was welcomed at the campsite by very nice young people, and they showed me where I can pitch my tent. The place was cute. It was just me in the field. And also close to toilets and bathrooms, which even had a shower with a jacuzzi.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_1_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was excited. The first time I was to sleep in a tent on a bicycle trip. When I traveled before, I only slept in guest houses. I bought a tent especially for this trip. I pitched the tent without any problems, because earlier at home, as it was new, I made a dry test. As it was my first night, I had concerns, but as soon as I went to sleep in the tent, I fell asleep and forgot that I was in the tent. The night passed smoothly.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 2</h2>
                                            <p>Szarejki - Mauda, 62 km</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I had breakfast at the campsite at 8 o'clock. And at this campsite they served such breakfast that I have never eaten one again at the campsite. I wrote about this breakfast <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#In">here</a>. All this together with pitching a tent for PLN 45. Something amazing. </p>
                                            <p>After Breakfast, I put up my tent, packed my bags and hit the road towards Gołdap. Later, before Gołdapia, I turned right towards the village of Czarne by the Black Lake. There I was to enter the Green Velo trail. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_1.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the meantime, I was running out of water on the main road and it was getting hot. I thought to myself that I would definitely buy somewhere in these small towns. But none of this. There was no store anywhere. The first time I experienced a lack of water on my bike. The heat was incredible. I must have traveled twenty kilometers without water. There was only a shop in Zawiszyn. I have just experienced a shortage of shops in Podlasie on my own leather. I've read about it before in various forums. People said that the distance between shops is a big downside to Green Velo. I decided to keep one bottle in stock from now on. I have always bought more than I need so that the situation does not happen again. It's terrible to go so long without water in such heat. If my tire detector had broken, I would probably have died there. After this incident, I never ran out of water again.</p>
                                            <p>After replenishing the water in Zawiszyn and a fruit meal, I headed east all the time already following the trail. The road was nice and the surface was great. As it turned out later, only short sections are asphalt, and most of Green Velo are gravel roads.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_2.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was slowly approaching the first attraction on my route, the bridges in Stańczyki. I wrote about them <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#here">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>After visiting the bridges in Stańczyki, I headed towards the Border Tripoint in Wisztyniec. I also slowly started looking for some agritourism on my phone. I knew there was no tent field nearby. I called several places but nobody answered the phone. Well, I thought I would definitely find something along the way. In a small town whose name I do not remember, I went to a shop to buy water and fruit. By the way, I asked for accommodation. It turned out that the shop owner's cousin runs agritourism in Mauda. I even got a phone number. At least, that's something. I have a bearing, I thought to myself. </p>
                                            <p>I got to Wisztyniec in the afternoon. There was a statue of Green Velo at the entrance to the parking lot.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_4.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>BSA (MOR in Polish) was also there. BSA stands for Biker Service Areas. There are many such points on the Green Velo route every 8-10 kilometers from each other. All BSA are uniformly marked and equipped with shelters, benches, U-shaped bicycle stands, information boards and litter bins, and some also with portable toilets and water tanks.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_5.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the parking lot, officers of the Polish Border Guard warned me not to take any photos of the Russian side of the border. It is a big mandate. It is also not allowed to cross this border, even by extending an arm or a leg. There are cameras everywhere. Once, a tourist took a photo of herself in front of the border crossing point and posted it on Facebook. She was tracked down and had to pay a mandate. Such stories told me.</p>
                                            <p>Having been warned by them, I went to the place where the borders of three countries meet: Poland, Russia and Lithuania. I just took a picture of myself in front of the information board.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_6.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>It was getting late. I called agritourism. It turned out that it was not far from Wisztyniec. I set up the navigation and went to the place that was shown to me. I was slowly beginning to feel the hardships of the landscape. This land is Masuria Garbate. The terrain is very undulating. Some hills were so steep that I had to get off the bike and push it. </p>
                                            <p>I arrived at Mauda in the late afternoon. I remember that there were a lot of storks sitting on the folded straw.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/GV_2_7.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There were very nice people in agritourism. They showed me my room and invited me to their house for dinner, which I had in the kitchen with them. This is what the people of Podlasie are like. They will take you home, feed you, and give you a place to stay. I am not saying that in other regions of Poland people are not like that, but in Podlasie and the entire eastern part of Poland, the kindness of people towards visitors is very much exposed. </p>
                                            <h2>Day 3</h2>
                                            <p>Mauda - Błaskowizna, 50 km</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/3.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the morning, the owners of agritourism invited me to their place for breakfast. After breakfast, I packed my bags and took the course to Wiżajny. There is a beautiful lake Wiżajny. I wanted to go to the town of Wiłkupie, the farthest north of Poland. There was a nicely landscaped beach with a pier.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/3_08.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was lying on the pier for two hours, jumping into the water, which was very warm, from time to time. It was 30 degrees C. The heat was unbearable.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/3_24.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was reluctant to leave the lake, but I had to keep going. I went to Mount Rowelska. It is the highest peak in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. Its height is 298.1 m above sea level. There is a high tower there, which of course I climbed.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/3_52.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>From the tower I could enjoy the view of the Suwałki Region and the land called Masuria Garbate.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/3_48.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Then I went to the town of Smolniki. There is a view point "Pan Tadeusz" from where you can admire the landscape of Suwałki Region, and above all Mount Cisowa, also known as Suwałki Fujyama. The mountain is 256 m above sea level and, according to legend, it was raised from the ground where Kopane Lake is now located.</p>

                                            <p>Riding further, I took a dip in Lake Hańcza in the town of Antosin. Lake Hańcza is the deepest lake in Poland. Its maximum depth is 108.5 m. The water in the lake is very cold, but during the heat that accompanied me all the time, you could swim in it without any problems. The lake has very clear water with high transparency. That is why it is a Mecca for divers who come there from all over Poland. There are many agritourism farms by the lake, which offer scuba diving equipment for rent. You can also load your oxygen cylinders there for diving.</p>

                                            <p>After taking a bath, I traveled around the lake and stopped at an agritourism farm by Lake Hańcza, in the village of Błaskowizna. The conditions were very good, it was very clean and the breakfast was so big that I couldn't eat it. I highly recommend this agritourism.</p>

                                            <p>Błaskowizna - Suwałki, 32 km</p>
                                            <p>After leaving agritourism, I headed to the seat of the Suwałki Landscape Park in Malesowizna - Turtul. There is the Tales of Turtul educational trail, the ruins of the old mill in Turtul, and the viewpoint on Oz Turtulski. Oz is a narrow embankment or a series of hills of glacial origin, usually several meters high and up to several dozen km long, with steep slopes, a winding course and a wavy dorsal line. Oz formed in the crevices of the ice sheet, where gravel and sand were deposited by the water.</p>

                                            <p>Seeing such a lake, I couldn't resist taking a bath in this heat. The lake was incredibly warm. The temperature of the air in the shade was 34.7 degrees C.</p>

                                            <p>My next point on the route was the Castle Mountain in Szurpiły.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>From it you could admire amazing views of the surrounding area, and above all of Lake Szurpiły.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>Then I was dehydrated for the first time. Despite the fact that I drank a lot of water and sports drinks. I started to feel dizzy and very faint. I stopped at a gas station in Jeleniewo and rested for two hours while hydrating myself. That day I decided to ride to Suwałki only.</p>

                                            <p>Suwałki - Przewięź, 74</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>The heat did not allow me to stay in the tent for too long. At 7 o'clock in the morning it was already 27 degrees C! So I packed up quickly and rode my bike on the way. On the way, I passed the Driver Training Center, where there was a company bar. So I ordered a fried potato cake. For the first time I had the opportunity to try a specialty from Podlasie. I really like fried potato cake. It was often eaten in my home. This one was not very good, as it was known to be a bar dish. But she was eaten. Chunks of meat and bacon were missing. My mom always did with meat inside and bacon. But it's always something.</p>

                                            <p>My first destination was the Post-Camaldolese Monastery on Lake Wigry. A beautiful monastery located on the island of Wigry, which later became a peninsula. The monastery has rooms for rent, so you can stay there for a few nights.</p>

                                            <p>I continued along the Green Velo trail that led me along Lake Wigry. I headed towards Czerwony Folwark.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>There are warehouses of the fishing base, and there is an exhibition devoted to the history and tradition of fishing at Lake Wigry. A very nice man who was inside told me a lot of interesting things about fishing and the breeding of whitefish in these areas. She also talked about the damage caused by cormorants in these areas among the whitefish farms. The whitefish is a very tasty freshwater fish. You can eat it here in any fish bar and restaurant.</p>

                                            <p>After the fishing lesson, I continued along the trail towards the Augustów Primeval Forest and the village of Mikaszówka. The trail was very difficult in the Augustów Primeval Forest. For over 10 km, the trail was covered with very sandy sand. For every 10 meters of cycling at a speed not exceeding 7-8 km per hour, there was 10 meters of pushing the bicycle on the sand. This is because there was drought and the sand was not compacted by rain. </p>
                                            <p>On the trail, I met two cyclists from Gdańsk. Like me, they were struggling with the difficult sand on the trail. We felt better together. You could say that if it weren't for them, I would have stayed in this forest for the night. I would pitch up a tent somewhere in the woods. It was so hard that I no longer had the strength to pedal and push the bike. After four hours of fighting with sand, we finally reached Mikaszówka where we were welcomed by a beautiful wooden church from 1907. </p>

                                            <p>There was also an impressive monument to the victims of the Augustów Manhunt. The monument was like a man submerged in the ground, with only his head and arms sticking out. It looked nice.</p>

                                            <p>On the way, we passed several water locks on the Augustów Canal. Impressive structures. </p>

                                            <p>Meanwhile, clouds had risen and a storm was brewing. We had to find accommodation as soon as possible. However, there was no agritourism anywhere, and the pensions we passed were closed. This is one of the downsides to traveling in low season. We found accommodation after 20 kilometers in Przewięź. For this time, we did not get off the bikes, but rode our bikes all the time over 20 kilometers per hour to make it before the storm. </p>
                                            <p>We arrived tired, but happy that we managed to make it before the storm. We even found some time to drink a beer and talk. The cyclists were from Gdańsk, so close to me. We had a few topics in common.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>We all slept in one room with our bikes in a small cottage. The room was very comfortable, the shower and bathroom was clean. But three people, three bikes and three sets of panniers are a bit too much. There is something to mention.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>One-day acquaintances on the road are nice. It's fun driving alone to meet someone new who has the same passion. But one day and one evening is enough. Either way, I prefer to ride alone. Nevertheless, such adventures add charm to each trip.</p>

                                            <p>We had breakfast together in the morning. Then the cyclists from Gdańsk quickly continued their journey. I calmly packed my stuff and headed towards Augustów. </p>
                                            <p>Augustów turned out to be a really nice city. I liked him much more than Suwałki, which seemed to be abandoned. Augustów, although it was the beginning of June, was teeming with life. I sat in the market for a while, went to the tourist information, where I got a map of the Green Velo trail. Ate pasta at some restaurant but it wasn't very good. Then I continued along the Green Velo trail towards Lake Sajno.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Traveling along the Augustów Canal is a must see here. Of course, I couldn't allow myself to do that. Because what would I do with a bicycle ... But I promised myself that someday I would come there without a bicycle.</p>

                                            <p>The trail in this place led me along beautiful forest roads.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>And then, along the Sajno Lake, right on its shores. Lovely place.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/6_35.jpg" />

                                            <p>In the tourist information office in Augustów, I got the address of a very interesting agritourism in Kopytkowo. I decided to spend the night there. They also had a campsite there. </p>
                                            <p>The road to Kopytków itself was boring and nothing happened. On the way, just in front of Kopytkowo, I saw only a roadside shrine. Such a thing characteristic of Podlasie. There are a lot of them here. </p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>I was welcomed by very nice people. You can rent rubber boots there and go on a guided hiking tour in the Biebrza marshes. There was an observation tower from which you could observe the Biebrza marshes and elks, which are said to be plenty here. However, I did not manage to see any.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 7</h2>
                                            <p>Kopytkowo - Pentowo, 86 km</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the morning, for breakfast, I got a portion of home-made cold cuts. They were really great. I highly recommend this place to stay. </p>
                                            <p>I packed my tent and left. I rode my bike into the Biebrza National Park.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>The landscape was very nice, I was riding along the Biebrza river for a long time. I saw rafting on the river.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/7_02.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Only the road surface was in bad shape. It was very hard to ride on it. I was getting fed up with this Green Velo trail. Driving on such a surface for hours is not pleasant. And with a maximum speed of 8-9 kilometers per hour. Drama. I did not want to ride along forest and field roads anymore. I would like to go on asphalt ...</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/7_07.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Finally, after Goniadz, I reached the famous Tsarist Road. I wrote about her <a href="../D_More Information/Curiosities.htm#Tsarist">here</a>. </p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>I saw speed bumps for the first time on an intercity road.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/7_12.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Due to these flies, I had to leave the Green Velo trail and go to Tykocin by a different route. On the way in Trzcianne I came across a nice developed center. I decided to take a break and eat something.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/7_13.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I got to Pentowo at eight in the evening, the owner of the agritourism welcomed me with delicious dumplings with meat and homemade cold meats. </p>
                                            <p>The town of Tykocin that I passed along the way was really nice. My agritourism in Pentowo was only two kilometers away from Tykocin. I decided to stay there for two full days and explore the whole area on foot.</p>
                                            <h2>Day 8, 9</h2>
                                            <p>Pentowo/Tykocin/Kiermusy, Days of rest</p>
                                            <p>My friend from Elbląg, who gave me a reference to this agritourism, did not lie to me. The owner turned out to be a wonderful man. Instead of pitching a tent, the owner offered me a whole house. For PLN 60 per night. I only had it to myself. There was also a shower ...</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/8,9_03.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>... but I preferred to use the shower outside. The water fell there by gravity from the reservoir and was heated by the sun. The charms of living in the countryside.</p>

                                            <p>I started my tour  from the European Stork Village in Dworek Pentowo. </p>

                                            <p>Every year, about 20-30 stork families come there. When you are in this area, it is a must-see.</p>

                                            <p>I started my tour of Tykocin with lunch at the Jewish restaurant Tejsza. Very nice atmosphere and good food. You cannot be in Tykocin and not visit Tejsza. Really worth. The restaurant is located in the basement, but also has a nice summer garden which of course I chose as my dinner location. I really like to eat fresh air. Anyway ... who doesn't like it.</p>

                                            <p>Later I visited the Great Jewish Synagogue. Through the electronic guide, I found out many things about the settlement of Jews in these areas and their customs.</p>

                                            <p>Tykocin is a really beautiful place, characterized by low buildings. I like this architecture very much. I don't like tall buildings.</p>

                                            <p>Tykocin is a very small town, but it is so nice and there is something to be seen in and around it, that I could write a whole chapter for it in this guide. <br />At the entrance to the very center of Tykocin, there is a beautiful baroque church.<br /></p>

                                            <p>It is also worth going outside the city to the nearby town of Kiermusy. I went there on foot as it is only 4.5 km from the city center of Tykocin.</p>

                                            <p>Pentowo - Jeroniki, 55 km</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>After leaving Pentowo, I headed straight to the Narew National Park on the Śliwno-Waniewo pontoon footbridge. I wrote about it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#T">here</a>.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>It is a shame that the pontoon footbridge over the Narew backwaters was closed... There will be an opportunity to come here again.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the vicinity of Waniewo I came across a beautiful roadside shrine.</p>

                                            <p>I chose a guesthouse in Jeroniki near Choroszcz for the night. They had "Cyclist friendly place" written on the door. And actually. The people were very nice. They prepared dinner. I could lock my bike in the garage. I washed my things. Whenever I'm in such civilized places, I try to wash my clothes, because you never know where I'll be sleeping next.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 11</h2>
                                            <p>Jeroniki - Sokołda, 53 km</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>My next point on the route was to be Białystok. I have been to this city several times in the past. But always by car and passing through. Now I decided to explore it a bit. Before leaving Choroszcz, I cooled down with ice cream on the main square. It is a must for me if I am taking my time. Sit down for a while in the main square and watch the city live. Then I watch people, what they are doing, are they in a hurry, and how they live in general. Of course, an hour is not enough to be able to judge something later, but it's always something. It's always better than flying through the city like crazy without looking at anything.</p>

                                            <p>I also toured the Branicki Palace in Choroszcz. I even wanted to visit it, but it was closed.</p>

                                            <p>Białystok turned out to be a beautiful city with a great main square. I did not expect that there is such a thing in Białystok. The building of the Town Hall is located in the central square. There are low buildings on both sides of the market, between which I feel very comfortable. I live in the old town of Elbląg and tenement houses are what I like the most. I don't like blocks of flats. I could never live in any of them. Old towns have their soul. It is true that the Old Town in Elbląg is quite young, but I will not write about it why, because this is not the place and this time.</p>

                                            <p>I also visited Planty Park and looked at the Branicki Palace in Białystok. A beautiful palace. Unfortunately, I couldn't go inside because I would have to leave the bike unattended for a long time. There are also downsides to cycling. It is not always possible to go everywhere, because you cannot leave the bike unattended. Something for something.</p>

                                            <p>Finally, before leaving, I went to the Podlasie bar, which was recommended to me by a colleague at work, who comes from this region. There I experienced "a return to the past". I wrote about it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#Podlasie">here</a>. PSS Społem. I don't know about you, but I like this institution. In the past, as a child, I always went to the Społem store, because there were no others. And so it stayed for me. I try to shop there, because there is a nice atmosphere in Elbląg. The ladies are nice, usually a bit older and polite. If there is such a store somewhere on my route, I will always go to it. I like to look at the interior, which often still remembers the old times. Talk to nice ladies. I just like it and that's it.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>In Białystok I saw something else that I have never seen anywhere before. Two-level bicycle paths. Something amazing. And this surface. Smooth as a table. The rest of Poland should learn from Białystok to build bicycle paths. I wish I had taken the photo. I left Białystok resentful that I had only been there for one day. I will definitely come back there someday. </p>
                                            <p>From Białystok I went to Supraśl. Another gem on my route. There is a great museum of icons there.</p>

                                            <p>And on the way to the guesthouse in Sokołda, such a curiosity. The trunk of a large pine tree that fell behind it was 350 years old.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>In the evening I wanted to give the agritourism owner money, but he said that we would settle up after my overnight stay. Okay, I thought, but I asked, "What if you're not here and I want to leave early in the morning?" Well, he said to me, "Then you will leave the money on the table." This is Podlasie.</p>

                                            <p>Today I was going to visit the Tatar village of Kruszyniany. On the way, I ate only amazing Russian dumplings with cream. I've never eaten better. And they had a completely different shape than the ones I knew. They were delicious.</p>

                                            <p>Finally I got to the mosque in Kruszyniany. Beautiful place. I wrote about him <a href="../D_More Information/Curiosities.htm#Tatar">here</a>. On the way I was hit by storm and rain, but I was prepared for it. I wore a raincoat and shoe covers. How you are well dressed on a bike, the weather does not matter. Anyway ... on a bike only the wind annoys you. The rain doesn't matter. Well, unless there is a cloud break. That's when you have to hide somewhere for a while.</p>

                                            <p>A few years ago the Tatarska Jurta restaurant burned down and was rebuilt from scratch. But now it doesn't look as nice as it used to be. I tried a few Tatar dishes and they were ... different. Anyway, it was very expensive there. But at least she has given me shelter from the storm. I sat in it for about two hours. It's always something.</p>

                                            <p>From Kruszyniany, I headed for Bobrowniki - Border Crossing. Actually, I didn't want to go there, but there was no other way. I had to get closer to the border with Belarus. There is no bad thing. There was a well-stocked shop where I ate "dinner". I wrote about it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Kitchen on the road.htm#Once">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>I slowly started looking for a place to stay, but there were no vacancies anywhere because a long weekend had started. After all, today was the Feast of Corpus Christi. Somehow I couldn't find a good place to pitch a tent in the wild. I had to keep going.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, I got to the place where agritourism should theoretically be, but it wasn't there. But the people who lived there offered me a night on the floor in their unfinished cottage. I wrote about it <a href="../Advices/Wild sleepover.htm#So">here</a>. Now, as I write this, I saw on their Facebook profile that they started running agritourism. Besides, the host used to be a cyclist as well. That's why they welcomed me so well. They even let me have a bath at their house. I highly recommend this place. </p>

                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>I left there very early, when the hosts were still asleep. I left 10 PLN for the hospitality and wrote a card that I thank them very much. Paradoxically, I got a lot of sleep on this floor. I was going to go in the direction of Hajnówka. I passed some great places along the way.</p>
                                            <p>Orthodox church of the Transfiguration in Topolany.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/13_03.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>And this is how bicycle paths are built in Podlasie. The rest of Poland should learn from them.</p>

                                            <p>I also visited houses in the Land of Open Shutters. </p>

                                            <p>This land is made up of three towns: Trześcianka, Soce and Puchły. I visited a beautiful Orthodox church in Puchły. I wrote about it <a href="../A_Introduction Topics/Places.htm#Orthodox">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>On the way I was caught heavy rain. I hid from him in some shed. But I was able to admire another Orthodox church on my route. Such as St. Michael the Archangel in Trześcianka. </p>

                                            <p>On the way to Hajnówka, I passed more Orthodox churches:</p>
                                            <p>St. James the Apostle in Łosinka.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>St. Prophet Elijah in Dubiny.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/13_45.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Every one is more beautiful. Really. I promised myself that I would see all the Orthodox churches in Podlasie someday. </p>
                                            <p>In Hajnówka, I decided to eat something, I asked people in the streets. Everyone recommended VERA PIZZA restaurants to me. They weren't lying. There was really good Italian food.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>I decided not to go any further, but to find a place to stay in Hajnówka. The more so as there were no vacancies anywhere in BIałowierza. This is season travel. I left Elblag a week too late. I found the night in quite a nice agritourism. They gave me the whole floor of the house for themselves, shared a washing machine. I was on cloud nine.</p>

                                            <h2>Day 14</h2>
                                            <p>Hajnowka - Kleszczele, 35 km</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/14.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I decided to go home the next day. I no longer had the mental strength to go on. For the first such trip alone, two weeks will be enough. However, I could not go from Hajnówka, because the railway tracks were under renovation. There was a backup bus service, but there was a risk that the bus driver would not pick up the bike. I had to get to the town of Kleszczele. So I went to Kleszczewo. On the way I pass these magnificent Orthodox buildings:</p>
                                            <p>Orthodox church st. Martyr Dymitr Solunski in Hajnówka.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Orthodox church of the Protection of the Mother of God in Dubicze Cerkiewne.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>And Orthodox church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in Kleszczele.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <h2>Day 15</h2>
                                            <p> It's time to ride home. </p>
                                            <p>My train to Białystok was early in the morning. So I had to hurry. At the station, however, I was still ahead of time.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/15_04.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I had just two hours to wait for the train to Elbląg so I went to the Podlasie bar to go back in time once again. I was lucky that some fair was just taking place.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/15_08.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p> I tasted the local specialties and went to the railway station in Białystok.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../Images_GV/15_07.jpg" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p>It was my first long trip. I discovered my weaknesses on it. And also the lack of equipment. I wasn't going to make the mistakes I made here anymore. I traveled 750 km. The next trip will surely be longer. I realized that on such a trip it is the human psyche that plays the most important role, not physical preparation. But that's how experience is gained.</p>
